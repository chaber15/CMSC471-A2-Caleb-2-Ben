      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We used the Chicago Crimes, 2001–present dataset, which contains every reported crime which occurred in the city of Chicago from 2001 to today. The raw data is scrapped from Chicago Police Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Because there were over 8 million crimes in the CSV file, processing and graphing all that data was simply not realistic, instead we chose to take data from the last 10 years (Jan 1st, 2014 - Dec 31st, 2024). We then further limited the data to Arson, Assault, Battery, Burglary, Homicide, Narcotics, Other, Robbery, Theft, Trespassing, Vandalism, and Vehicle Theft, because those were the most common crimes committed and because that was the maximum amount of data that could be displayed on the graph while still being readable.
